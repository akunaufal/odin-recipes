	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>A meatball recipe that rivals that of your favorite Italian restaurant! These meatballs always come out amazingly tender, perfectly moistened, deliciously flavorful and they're always sure to impress! Makes for such a classic, comforting dinner.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups (5.2 oz) fresh bread crumbs*</li>
		<li>3/4 cup whole milk, then more if needed</li>
		<li>1 lb. 85% lean ground beef**</li>
		<li>1 lb. ground pork</li>
		<li>2 large eggs</li>
		<li>1/2 cup finely minced yellow onion***</li>
		<li>2 garlic cloves, minced (2 tsp)</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh basil</li>
		<li>2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
		<li>1 Tbsp finely chopped fresh oregano</li>
		<li>1 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese
		Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
		<li>3/4 cup olive oil, only if using the fried method</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large mixing bowl stir together bread crumbs and milk while adding more milk 1 Tbsp at a time to moisten bread fully. Let rest while you prep ingredients (or at least 5 minutes).
		</li>
		<li>To breadcrumb mixture add beef, pork, eggs, onion, garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, parmesan and season over top of ingredients evenly with salt and pepper (I only use 3/4 tsp salt if I plan on using jar sauce to coat since it can be salty).</li>
		<li>Gently toss mixture and break meat up with fingertips until ingredients are evenly mixed.</li>
		<li>Shape mixture with greased hands into even size meatballs, about 1 1/4-inches each (or about 38g).</li>
		<li>To pan fry meatballs pour 3/4 cup olive oil into a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat over medium heat.
		</li>
		<li>Cook meatballs in 3 batches (so they aren't overcrowded) until golden brown on bottom, about 4 - 6 minutes. Then turn to opposite side and cook opposite side until golden brown. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
		<li>Transfer meatballs to warmed marinara sauce (see note 5) in a large pot, submerge in sauce. Cover and simmer over low heat until meatballs are 165 degrees in center, gently tossing meatballs occasionally, about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
